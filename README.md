## 📲 How The App Works
- Daily Mental Health Check-In: Tell the Beaver how you're feeling today and why
- AI generates 4 Daily Quests:
  - 2 Personalized Quests to counter the negative emotions you're feeling (If you're feeling mad, try some breathing exercises)
  - 2 Canadian Quests to get you more comfortable with Canadian culture (Buy a coffee from Tim Hortons)
- AI also generates 3 Monthly Quests:
  - 2 Event Quests: Major public events that have a specific time and location (Check out a Raptors game)
  - 1 Landmark Quest: Visit a local landmark (CN Tower, ROM, or Eaton Center)
- Complete Quests to collect Maple Leaves
- Use Maple Leaves to decorate your Beaver Avatar by buying Beaver Skins
- Diary Feature: Beaver will ask you 3 follow-up questions based on your feelings today to dive deeper into your emotions
